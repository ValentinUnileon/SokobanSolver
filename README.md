## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

https://github.com/ValentinUnileon/SokobanSolver.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd sokoban-solver

3. Run the unit tests:

python tests.py

4. Experiment with the main program to solve your own Sokoban puzzles inserting them in puzzle.txt.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: Contains the main functions to solve Sokoban puzzles.
- `test_sokoban.py`: Unit test file to verify the functionality of the main program.
- `puzzle.txt`: Example file containing a Sokoban puzzle encoded as characters.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project and how to use it.
